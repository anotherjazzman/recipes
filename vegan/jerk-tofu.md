# Jamaican Jerk Tofu

This is the kind of miracle dish that can convert anyone to tofu. The Jamaican "jerk" seasoning is sure-to-please. It's sort of like barbeque and sort of like curry, savory and sweet at the same time. Just make sure you allow plenty of time for the pressing and marinating. The drier the tofu gets before you put it in the marinade, the better. It will soak up more flavor and be nicely chewy. 

## Ingredients

    1 lb extra firm tofu, drained, sliced and pressed (see directions)
    1/2 large sweet onion, roughly choppped
    4 cloves garlic
    2 Tbs fresh ginger, grated
    Juice of 2 limes
    Zest of 1 lime
    2 Tbs soy sauce
    2 Tbs olive oil
    3 Tbs pure maple syrup
    1 Tbs dried thyme
    2 tsp allspice
    1/2 tsp cayenne
    1 tsp nutmeg
    1/2 tsp cinnamon
    2 jalapeno peppers, seeded and chopped (you can cut back to one or omit entirely if you like spicy) 

## Directions

1) Slice the tofu into thick slabs then lay the slices on several layers of paper towels or on a clean dish towel and place a heavy plate or skillet on top. 

2) Let it sit for an hour or two. Pressing the tofu is a way to get the extra moisture out - and the drier you can get the tofu, the more of the flavorful marinade it can absorb.

3) Puree all the rest of the ingredients in a blender or food processor to create the marinade. 

4) Place the tofu slices in a bowl, pour in the marinade, making sure to coat all the slices, and cover. Let it sit for an hour or two, flipping the slices about halfway through

5) Heat a skillet with a small amount of olive oil over medium high heat. When the pan is hot, lay the tofu slices in a single layer and saute until crispy and browned. That will take 8-10 minutes on each side.
